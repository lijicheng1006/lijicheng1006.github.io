Welcome to Jicheng Li's homepage!

Thank you for taking the time to visit!

I am Jicheng Li, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Delaware, specializing in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. I am currently a member of the Human-Computer Interaction lab.

My research primarily focuses on Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. Specifically, I have been involved in projects related to deep learning applications in action quality assessment and intervention evaluation.

I am fortunate to have Dr. Roghayeh Barmaki as my advisor, who provides invaluable guidance and support throughout my academic journey.

Aside from my passion for research, I have diverse interests outside of academia. I enjoy listening to music, playing sports, and watching movies. In fact, these hobbies serve as a great source of inspiration and relaxation for me.

On a personal note, I am a proud owner of a cat and a chinchilla. They bring joy and companionship to my life.

Once again, thank you for visiting my homepage. Feel free to explore more about my research and interests.
